# Schwinger boson code for Maple leaf lattice

We have the Heisenberg model with three different 1st nn bonds.

# Jt=0

We start by keeping Jt = 0 and verify the phases we get.

## To do list
    - Write script for structure factor with Bogoliubov 
    - See why the condensate SSF is not precise
    - Check why sometimes L does not converge nicely
    - Check why sometimes the solution is wrong
    - Check O part of final energy
