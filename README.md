# Schwinger Boson Mean Field decoupling applied to Maple Leaf lattice

Hamiltonian:

We perform a chiral PSG classification -> 2 ansatze.

We look at classical magnetic orders -> classical phase diagram.

We perform minimization of the mean field parameters in the SBMFT and find the quantum phase diagram.

#Classical phase diagram
We derived the classification for the regular magnetic orders on the ML lattice. 
This yields: FM, Neel, 6 orders with 6-site unit-cell denoted a-Cn, 2 orders with 6x4 sites in the UC called NC2, 1 order with 6x9 sites called NC3.
We derive the formulas for the energies, which may depend on someparameters like the orientation of the initial spin used to construct the order.

In `classical_phase_diagram.py` we computete classical phase digram for 1st nn Heisenberg model with 3 inequivalent bonds (Jh, Jt and Jd).
